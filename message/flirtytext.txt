I have nothing interesting to say, but I really wanted to be with you.
Have you thought about me at all today? Type “Y akeno” for yes.
Lunch was fun! I love sitting across from you and near with your legs.
I gotta be honest: That hair twirl and lip bite is one of my favorite things you do.
I’m in bed and soooo cold. I need a cuddle buddy.
Can I sleep in your sweatshirt tonight? No need to reply I'm coming anyways...
I never get bored of thinking about you or much better talking to you.
You’re world champion at making me grin like an idiot.
Wanna know my biggest regret? Mine is not climbing over the table to kiss you last night.
You’re looking particularly hot right now. Don’t worry, I’m not stalking you… just assuming you look as good as always.
I’m out shopping and am in the dressing room and this bikini keeps reminding me of you.
Wanna pick out my outfit for date night? You can start with my underwear.
Netflix and Chill?
My bed smells like you, but I’m worried the smell is fading fast. I hope you make it back soon.
I had a dream about you last night. I’d tell you about it, but it’s super inappropriate so I have decided to tell when you come over.
What’s your favorite part of my body?
I’m at work. I guess I forgot something at your place...
Have I told you how much I enjoy your lustful and spicy lips?
I’m bored. Tell me about a sex dream you’ve had.
I bet you, I can make it hard for you to get up from your desk without embarrassing yourself.
I’m having some particularly R-rated thoughts right now and you’re the star of all of them.
Can’t wait until you’re by my side, again… or on top. Whatevs.
Bet you can’t make me blush. (Or: You know, you’re really good at making me blush.)
I had a dream we were sexting. Imagine my disappointment when I woke up and realized we weren’t… yet.
I’m starving and I don’t want to go out to eat so bring my dinner with you at my home at 4:20...
If you’re trying to decide if you should hit on me or not, you definitely should.
How much longer until you realize I like you and you tell me you like me, too?
Last night was mmmmmmmmmmmm omg...... Thanks for the delicious meal.
How many licks till I get to the center of it? I meant the cream....
I love it when you whisper in my ear, gives my body goosebumps.
I can’t stop thinking about your delicious scent.
Would love to have a shoulder rub from you right about now and you know what comes next..
Do you miss me? Type “Y akeno” for yes.
Why don’t we take this conversation offline and a little more personal?
I couldn’t wait the "break" / "cool-off time" so here I am texting you now.
Seeing a text from you pop up gives me an adrenaline rush.
Hi, I have nothing to say but just wanted to say I was thinking of you.
Oh, so this is what butterflies feel like? 🙂 Interesting.
We just said bye but I miss you already.
You may be out of sight, but you’re never out of my mind.
I’m cold. I just wish you could come over and warm me up...
Your scent on my pillow is my favorite smell.
How would you like a long, slow massage? (Come over.)
We should call in sick tomorrow and spend all day in bed.
Let’s go to bed early and sleep late.
I can’t stop thinking about when you grabbed me from the back..... unexpectedly.
It’s been way too long since you said me those 3 magical words that every girl craves to hear from you..
Today sucked. I need you to come over to cheer me up.
It’s hard to concentrate on work when you keep popping into my head.
I have your favourite dish ready and a weekend off from work. The only thing missing is you.
You’re going to think I’m lying, but you’re pretty much my dream guy.
Do you think I would look better in a skirt or tight jeans?
Did I tell you what I call my boobs? Your lollipops
I’m so excited about our date tonight. If you play your cards right, then you’re going to love what I’ve got planned for later.
I just finished a book I know you would love. You should come over to pick it up.
I have a few ideas for dessert later, and I’m not talking about ice cream. 
Every message you send me is like a small gift.
In my mind, I’ve got your arms wrapped tight around me.
I still can’t believe that licking technique you did on my sweet honey pot.
How long until I can bury my face in your neck again? Gosh I can't wait, I'm coming over.
The only argument I ever want to have with you is whether you’re big spoon or small spoon.
